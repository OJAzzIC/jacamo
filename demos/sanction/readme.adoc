This JaCaMo demo application illustrates the use of _sanctions_. It implements the following "history":

1. A norm is activated and obliges Alice to do something in 3 seconds. The norm is:
```
    norm n1: vl(X) & X > 5
       -> obligation(alice,n1, b(0), `now`+`3 seconds`)
       if unfulfilled: s1(alice,X).
```

2. Alice does not fulfill the obligation on time!

3. The sanction `s1` is thus triggered and obliges Bob to decide whether to fine Alice or not. The sanction specification is:
```
    sanction s1(A,X): c(Y) -> obligation(bob,true,fine(A,X*Y),`now`+`2 seconds`)
       if unfulfilled: s2.
```

4. Bob also decides to not fulfill its obligation!

5. So, sanction `s2` is triggered. Its specification is:
```
    sanction s2 -> remove_from_systems(bob).
```

6. In this case, the sanction is implemented (instrumented) in the environment. An artifact executes operation to realize  `remove_from_systems(bob)`.


## Notes

* The specification of the norms and sanctions are in file link:./src/org/demo.npl[demo.npl]

* The application is executed by agent Karlos that:

  -  Creates the artifact `NormativeBoard` responsible to compute obligations and sanctions based on the normative specification of `demo.npl`.
  - Creates the artifact `Sanctioner` responsible to implement in the environment to brute consequences of sanctions.
